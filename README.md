# LLM-Cure

## Abstract
LLM-Cure, a novel approach powered by large lan-
guage models (LLMs) to automatically generate suggestions for
mobile app feature improvements by leveraging insights from the
competitive landscape. LLM-Cure operates in two phases. First, it
identifies and categorizes high-level features within reviews using
its LLM capabilities. Secondly, when provided with a complaint in
a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated features in compet-
ing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improve-
ments tailored to the target application.
