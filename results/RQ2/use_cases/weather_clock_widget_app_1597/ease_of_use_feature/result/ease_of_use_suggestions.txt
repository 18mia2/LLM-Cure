Based on the positive user reviews about the "Ease of Use" feature from competitive apps, here are three enhancements that could address the user complain about the weather mobile application's widget not updating over time:

1. **Automatic Refresh:** Implement an automatic refresh feature for the widget that updates the weather and time data periodically, so users don't have to manually tap on the widget to see the current weather and time.
2. **Improved Time Synchronization:** Enhance the clock functionality in the widget to ensure that it stays in sync with the device's internal clock, eliminating the need for manual time updates.
3. **Clear Refresh Icon and Options:** Provide a clear refresh icon and add options for users to manually refresh the widget, change clock fonts, and customize the weather update intervals to their preference. This will give users more control over the widget's behavior and improve their overall experience.
