User review containing complain about the Radar feature:
Needs a radar view for everyone's local area. This takes away from the app not having it.

List of positive user reviews from competitive apps about the Radar feature:

I love that it puts my current location on the radar maps. Great interface.
Exactly what I need. Easy to find radar. Easy to view by location or other areas. Use it daily.
Good
Nice features easy to use. All around good app. Only problem I noticed is the radar feature it just shows a map of your area but no actual radar of weather systems. Oops disregard that last. Radar issue on my phone resolved itself.
I mostly use it to track the radar but gives me some idea of the current temperature and what's coming in the next 10 days. Can also check the weather in favorite locations.
It could use some improvements like better radar and a12 week outlook. But overall good
The free version is okay definitely worth the $.99 to upgrade. The radars could be better and more user friendly. I would like to see a future option on the radar so I could plan for later on in the day. Other than that kids a really good weather app.
Really like the local radar
I like the local weather radar.
Needs to have a live radar view
I like the live radar. Wish it was a longer time Frame though.
Update. I put it on my gs6 and it is just perfect. My prior comments were using a note4. Old comment: I liked the prior version better. The map zooms in too far and the location icon is too large. I'd like to see a control for radar history time and scroll speed. No issues with it updating that I know of. I mainly use it for radar maps tho.
Great coverage of local weather. The radar map is always helpful to see whats comming.
Other than the lack of live radar this is a great weather app. I like being able to see weather in places I have friends and family and in other cities I love to visit.
It could update the radar quicker than every 20 minutes but still this is the best weather program available period. It will track your location where ever you are using GPS. Great for people whose job location depends on good weather. Don't be fooled by some higher ratings. There are no other weather apps better than this one. Get it now! TRUST ME!
Just needs better access to active radar (shows where the the rain is coming from / where its going). Otherwise nice job.
Radar update with gps location is very accurate  helps me in my road trip planning avoiding snow hazards. Loved it. Much better than weather channel. It has variety of radar scans temperature etc.
It would be nice if there was a quick way to look at the radar map. Instead I have to scroll pretty far down. UPDATE: there appears to be a link to the radar next to current weather conditions (unless that's only temporary due to storms in the area). However I do not like the storm cells layer that is always overlaid on the radar: it blocks the surrounding geography rendering the radar data useless. I did finally locate the setting to turn it off but it is buried and annoying to have to do this every time I view the radar.
Gives you all your weather info you need to know about. Love the live radar wish it would give longer live viewing though.
Best weather app I've tried. Good location settings and alerts. Only thing I would like improved is the radar portion. It only shows the radar up until the current time not the rest of the day or even a couple hours into the future.
Works pretty good. The radar is little slow but way better than my local news
I love the lightning monitor. I wish it were better integrated with the radar map however. Also I would like them to add storm tracks so you could see where the cell is headed.
Quick access to radar would be awesome. Also that little notification on the clock is annoying
It is good but i think it needs features like showing u when a cyclone and stuff is coming on the radar map instead of having to choose between icons just so u can find out my point of view .
Needs a better radar and also doesn't update my notification bar with my area temperature and any alerts.
Lots of great features! Radar is extremely accurate  follows your location! Very efficient! Haven't noticed any errors or problems! I highly recommend this app!
Great For checking the weather. But hard to get local radar For my area but still A great app Thanks
Used to have issues with loading and connecting but now it works great. Lots of info love the radar. Keep it up dev. Only suggestion is maybe expand on the live footage of whether conditions. I like the idea of being able to click on a map of where I'm going and seeing in real time what the weather is like.
Awesome wish I could see a radar option when I need too though
I like 1weather better than accweather it has a lot more features the only thing that could use some work is the radar is a little slow so I give it four stars if I could give it four & a half that's what i would give it
The radar view takes a few times before the pictures are in order. Otherwise fantastic app. I highly recommend this app for avid campers people who love to be in the know of weather and for people who want to stay informed. I.e. Amber silver alerts dust flood extreme weather warnings. Fix the radar and it's a solid 5 stars
Tells me everything i nerd to know i do prefer the radar view on Radar Express better but thats pretty petty
Like it except for when I try to zoom in on the radar map to see exactly where if a storm is in my area and then it says that it can't load the radar overlay. Otherwise good app and pretty good with predicting the weather in my area.
I've been using it for several years and have been totally pleased. I particularly like the severe weather warning & radar features. Keep up the good work.
Perhaps add available local Web cams to see weather in real time. Also my be cool click a place on the map and get temporary weather reading that will not stay in my locations.
The radar map used to automatically show a pin w/ your current location. The pin made it very convenient to track the direction of the weather.
Radar is real good and I get good info when storms are coming my way the amber alerts are awsome which I share among my friends I share the radar too with my local friends good app. I like this one better than all the other weather apps only one small fault this app could be quicker to upload on the radar and other features...all in all very very good
Needs more radar and map functions. Also I'd live to see a paid version without ads.
Works very good. And is full of features. Although it would be nice to have a future radar feature.
Really like this weather app---only thing that could be better is if the radar map could do a time lapse so you could see which way the storms are moving
Update: I now give it five stars. They fixed the radar map and the quick zoom on the map. Good on them. Forecast accuracy still excellent. Just a warning the radar movingmap can be as much as 15 minutes behind. But everyone has that problem the NWS composite can take that long. Best weather app I've seen.
Also when traveling made it easy to find weather with location tracking.
Not always accurate but decent. Though it is hard to keep up with daily weather changes. I really love the radar
This is very nice application. Only one thing is missing and if it would be there then I sure would give one star more... And that is missing radar map....
I like that you have multiple display options. Also you can see both a live radar motion and a map of the area of the weather's activity condition on ground before it arrives in your location. So far I like it except for too many apps pop-ups for the same products. Let us search for them if we want them.
All the weather details I could want in one place... really love the up to date radar! Wish there was a wind direction/velocity map though. Would be very useful in the tornado prone area we live in.
Love it pinpoints my exact location.others don't don't get radar to work when I really need it
My go to app for weather for years. Latest update removed location marker on radar please return it. Please make storm cell markers optional on radar rather thsn the default. Thanks
Great weather app. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an extended radar view. I would like to know where storms are heading 2-4 hours from the current time.
Like the App. Wish that the radar map loaded faster but it has a very nice layout. I also like how they provide local photography as the background.
This works very well. It could have better features like the 'MyRadar' app out there offers they show the wind currents as a layer in the free version but otherwise I enjoy weatherbug
Need better local radar updates but overall good.
Best weather app. Love the live radar and alerts! Easy to use and when I travel I can get local weather wherever I need it along with nationwide radar!
What happened to the Moving Radar View. That 3 hour app let a person actually see weather movement speed and direction.
I love the close up radar maps. Also I love to keep track of all my family and friends Weather. Thanks Weather Channel!
Use it nearly everyday especially when travelling. Prefer this map to other radar maps but I liked the earlier simple version with less clutter..
The only thing I would like to see is a radar view of the area it's giving stats for. Otherwise it seems to be the best app out there
Like it overall but radar needs upgrade very plain and basic
The best weather app available. Only improvement that I'd like to see is the radar.
The features are great but the radar could use a tune up as sometimes it doesn't show weather it's going to rain or anything else it's sometimes blank.
Have used this for years but it had gotten a little buggy. Recent updates have been quite good though esp radar and alerts. Highly recommended. (S4)
Easy to use with up to the minute information. We live in an area of severe weather. We don't constantly watch the radar but this is a must have when we NEED to watch the radar!
Liked th old radar much better. It is now much slower throughout the whole app.
Would like to see the live radar a little faster and easier to access.
Very informative I like how the current conditions & temp are always displayed on my notifications bar. I also like how it gives alerts for local weather threats. Only improvement needed is the radar sometimes takes a long time to load or won't play.
Has a decent radar map function. Gives timely alerts based on the National Weather Service system. Sometimes is a bit slow even when there is a strong signal. Otherwise I'd probably give it 5 stars
I love the radar showing where rain and storm cells are headed. The lighting tracker is pretty awesome too. The weekly forecast and current conditions are suprisingly accurate and very local. Hourly forecast are pretty much useless however. Overall a great weather app the best one!
App works great several great features radar maps function well my go to weather source.
I love this app because it gives you in depth analysis of your local weather. It also has Doppler radar as well to view the weather in real time. I definitely recommend this app.
Overall a good app. Would be nice if the radar had longer loop (2-3 hours) and could be slowed down. It would also be helpful if you could provide archived information to see what past weather conditions were.
Being limited to northern sucks. Can't view hurricanes the way I like. App is not cluttered which is a huge plus. Make better radar and get FIVE STARS.
I enjoy the radar and the news. Its easy to use. I like to see what the weather is doing in my home state.
I like easy access to radar & lately you have been better than acuweather and weather channel
Works well. Good radar. Like seeing current temp in notification bar.
It's a good easy app. But y'all need to update the radar to real time and make it where you can see an hour ahead not a half hour before.
I can always check the possible weather issues when I need to having the Radar and satellite views come in quite handy for making my own predictions!
I really wish I could see the future radar instead of only the past. Otherwise I really like this weather app
Love the radar map and the constant temp update and weather warnings. What i do not like is the unaccurate hourly weather. It does not seem very accurate. I use the radar a lot more.
Location Radar doesnt always work well sometimes it has problems finding Towns/ cities when typed in. App quite acurate when it comes to weather.
The only thing it is missing when compared to other weather apps is an option for animated map/radar.
Really good weather app....could use better radar though...overall two thumbs up.
Easy to find weather radar. Still the best
Great overall app for weather tracking. I wish there was a future option when viewing the radar. It would be nice to see where particular storms are headed. It would be also nice to have hurricane trackers during hurricane season. Like I stated earlier great overall app.
This is the best weather app in my area my local TV weather uses it too. Can't beat it give it a try best radar around
Could use more radar info. Wind maps would help
Radar could use some work but good otherwise
Has the features I love but with the recent update it lost my favorite. I can no longer see both the radar and the IR layers together. It's like trying to see the weather with only one eye open at a time.
Easy to use and gives me everything I want to know. The radar is better looking than anything else I have seen or used.
App shows all the info I need for my day or the week. I like the radar when bad weather is on it's way. It does a great job of tracking my location as well.
Way better radar than acuweather. This one lets you zoom in over your specific area
Really like the look and all the information presented in the widget. My wish is for easier access to radar
Just wish weather map gave a future option. Has gotten much better at finding your location and update maps though. Like the pollen forcast.
Would be 5 stars but no future mode for the radar/map. That is a function I use a lot.
Wait now after this last update it doesn't work as good. If you go to radar it freezes up. Also the zoom in and zoom out can be really faulty. Please fix and Ill gladly give you 5*.            Tells me the forcast  and sends alerts to let me know if bad weather is coming. Love that even in a storm I can pull up the radar(satellite tends to go out). Thank you for keeping me and my kids safe.
This is the only weather app that I can look at local and surrounding regoins doplar radar just with the zoom button
No thing you I can ask for more  so helpful about everything like when it rains in my area and love the future feature on the radar a lot.
I would give a 5 but the radar is not the most up to date when you play it.. I would like to be able to see a hour ahead to see which way the storm is moving.. Otherwise I love using this app.
